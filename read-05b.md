**Comparison operators**
You can compare a situation by comparing one value in the script to what expect it might be. the result will be a Boolean, True or False.

**Types of comparison operators**
1. is equal to **"=="**, it compares two values to see if they are the same
for example, 3='3' returns True

2. is not equal to **"!="** it compares two values to see if they are not the same, for example, 
'Hello'='Goodbye' returns true because they are not the same string

3. strict equal to **"==="**, it compares two values to check that both data type and value are the same. For example '3'===3 returns false  

4. strict not equal to **!==**, it compare two values to check out both the data type and value are not equal. For example, '3'!=='3' returns false

5. there are many different operators, like greater than **>** , less than **<**, greaterr than or equal **>=**, less than or equal **<=**

**Example of embodying some of these comparison operators**

var pass = 50; II Pass mark
var score = 90; II Score
II Check if t he user has passed
var hasPas sed = score >= pass ;
II Wr ite the message i nto the page
var el = document .getEl ementByld(' answe r ');
e 1 . t extContent = 'Leve 1 passed: ' + has Passed;


**logical operators**
it allows you to compare the results of more than once comparison operator. For example ((5>2) && (2<+3)) it returns false
