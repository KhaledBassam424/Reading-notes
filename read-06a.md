# color
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:

**rgb values**
These express colors in terms of how much red, green andblue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)

**hex codes**
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80

**color names**

There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan

**The default background color**
If you do not specify a background color, then the
background is transparent. By default, most browser windows have a white background, but browser users
can set a background color for their windows, so if you want to be sure that the background
is white.

**Padding**

We have also used the padding property to separate the text from the edges of the boxes. This makes it easier to read

**Color nature** 

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker. Understanding Color
Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels (if you look very closely at your monitor you should be able to see them).
When the screen is not turned on, it's black because it's not emitting any light. When it's on, each pixel can be a different
color, creating a picture. The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue â€”
just like on a television screen.


**RGB Values**

Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.
rgb(102,205,170) This color is made up of the following values: 102 red 205 green 170 blue


**Hex Codes**


Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code. #66cdaa The value of the red, 102, is
expressed as 66 in hexadecimal code. The 205 of the green is expressed as cd and the 170 of the blue equates to aa.


**Color Names**
Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number. MediumAquaMarine There are 147 color names
supported by browsers (this color is MediumAquaMarine). Most consider this to be a limited color palette, and it is hard to remember the name for
each of the colors so (apart from white and black) they are not commonly used.


**Hue**

Hue is near to the colloquial idea of color. Technically speaking however, a color can also have saturation and brightness as
well as hue.

**Saturation**

Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be
mostly gray.

**Brightness**

Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color. At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color.
At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark.
